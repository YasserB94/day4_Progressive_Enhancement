            <p class="story-paragraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening,
                all of his neighbours came around to commiserate. They said,<q class="neighbours">We are so sorry to
                    hear your horse has run away, This is most unfortunate.</q>The farmer said,<q
                    class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
                in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="neighbours">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great
                    turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
            </p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
                he
                was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbours then said, <q class="neighbours">Oh dear, that's too
                    bad,</q>
                and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
            </p>
            <p class="story-paragraph">
                The next day the conscription officers came around to
                conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
                neighbours came around and said,<q class="neighbours">Isn't that great!</q>Again, he said,
                <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
            </p>

            <blockquote class="conclusion">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
                and
                it's really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad â€” because you never
                know
                what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good
                fortune.</blockquote>

            <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective.Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for
                bananas.
